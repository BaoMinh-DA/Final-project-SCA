## Introduction
Predicting rental house prices in India using machine learning models. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to identify the best-performing model for accurate predictions.

## Data Collection and Preparation
### Data Sources
The data was collected from various sources, including public housing datasets and real estate websites.

### Data Cleaning
- Dropped irrelevant columns
- Split and transformed columns like `house_type` and `house_size`
- Handled missing values

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Summary Statistics
- Provided insights into the distribution of key features such as price, house size, and number of rooms.

### Visualizations
- Created histograms to visualize the distribution of rental prices.

- Plotted correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between features.

## Feature Engineering
- Created new features such as `distance_to_center` to add more predictive power to the models.
- Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.

## Model Building
### Models Used
- **Linear Regression:** Simple linear model to establish a baseline.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble model to capture complex interactions between features.
- **XGBoost:** Advanced boosting algorithm for high accuracy.

## Model Evaluation
### Performance Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.
- **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Score:** Used for Random Forest.

### Comparison
- Evaluated model performance using the metrics mentioned above.
- Identified the best-performing model based on R-squared and MSE.

## Results
- The Random Forest model had the highest R-squared value and the lowest MSE, and high oob-score  making it the most accurate model for predicting rental prices.
- Feature importance analysis revealed key factors influencing rental prices, such as house size, number of bathrooms, and location.
